# p-invoke.net

This website contains most of the P/Invoke definitions from the now offline [pinvoke.net](http://pinvoke.net/), adding the link to the Microsoft documentation for each one.

You can find the Github repository with all these files [here](https://github.com/ricardojoserf/pinvoke.net).

### Notes

- I did this to check some definitions in a quick way because I used pinvoke.net a lot, but there are more professional solutions like [CsWin32](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32).

- The website contains almost 2500 files, the limit for Gitbook, but pull requests are more than welcome (if a definition is wrong or if you want to add new ones).
